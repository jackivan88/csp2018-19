    <p>You'll have to take screenshots of your work throughout this course, so it's important to learn how to do it quickly
        and correctly. If you're using macOS, then you have some tools built in that we'll use. If you're using Windows,
        you need to install ShareX since the built-in Windows screenshot tools aren't quite good enough for what we need
        to do. Go to the section for your operating system and complete the checkpoints.</p>

    <h2>Checkpoint 1: Full Screen</h2>

    <p>Take a screenshot of your entire screen by pressing the <code>Print Screen</code> button on your keyboard. Find the file in your
        ShareX folder.</p>

    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>

    <h2>Checkpoint 2: Selection</h2>

    <p>Take a screenshot of only part of your screen by pressing <code>Control-Print Screen</code> and clicking and dragging to select
        a region. Find the file in your ShareX folder.</p>

    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>

    <h2>Checkpoint 3: Window</h2>

    <p>Open Windows Explorer and then screenshot only that window by pressing <code>Control-Print Screen</code> and then hovering over
        that window and clicking. Find the file in your ShareX folder.</p>

    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>

    <h2>Checkpoint 4: Full Screen Recording</h2>

    <p>Press <code>Shift-Print Screen</code> and make sure you select the entire screen. If it asks you to install FFMPEG, do so. Record
        your screen for five to ten seconds and then press Shift-Print Screen again. Find the file in your ShareX folder.</p>

    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>

    <h2>Checkpoint 5: Partial Screen Recording</h2>

    <p>Press <code>Shift-Print Screen</code> and make sure you select only a part of your screen. Record your selection for five to ten
        seconds and then press <code>Shift-Print Screen</code> again. Find the file in your ShareX folder.</p>

            work on stretch projects.</p>
