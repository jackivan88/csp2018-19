# Logic

We will study basic logic in the form of sentence logic as well as
memorize the truth tables you will use most frequently in programming.
The exercises are taken with permission from the book *A Modern Formal
Logic Primer* by Paul Teller.

## Checkpoint 1: Join the CSP 2018-19 Class on Quizlet

Go to Quizlet and log in. If you've never created a Quizlet account, do so now using your school email. Then join the CSP 2018-19 class so you have access to the logic truth tables that you will need to memorize.

<p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint. Alternatively, you may record
        your screen as you complete each step from this checkpoint and submit the videos for credit.</p>

## Checkpoint 2: Logic as the Science of Argument 

You will [read Chapter 1 of *A Modern Formal Logic Primer* by Paul
Teller](aModernFormalLogicPrimer/1ch1.pdf)
for Checkpoints 2-7. This is expected to take place in class, and at any
point you can stop and get clarification from Mr. Olinda. Read pages 1-4
of Chapter 1 before completing the exercise.

> **Exercise 1-1:** Explain in your own words what an argument is. Give
> an example of your own of an inductive argument and of a deductive
> argument. Explain why your example of an inductive argument is an
> inductive argument and why your example of a deductive argument is a
> deductive argument.

Your answer should be developed in writing and must be complete, simple,
and concise. You will not move on to the next checkpoint unless your
answer addresses each part of the exercise. Break the exercise down into smaller pieces and address each one. Write your answer as [a reply to this post](https://chapelfieldschools.sharepoint.com/sites/csp2018-19/SitePages/Checkpoint-2--Logic-as-the-Science-of-Argument.aspx).

## Checkpoint 3: Sentences and Connectives

Read pages 4-7 of Chapter 1 before completing the exercise.

> **Exercise 1-2:** Transcribe the following sentences into sentence
> logic, using `G` to transcribe `Pudding is good`. and `F` to
> transcribe `Pudding is fattening`.
>
> 1.  Pudding is good and pudding is fattening.
>
> 2.  Pudding is both good and fattening.
>
> 3.  Pudding is either good or not fattening.
>
> 4.  Pudding is not good and not fattening.
>
> You may well have a problem with the following transcriptions, because
> to do some of them right you need to know something I haven't told
> you yet. But please take a try before continuing. Trying for a few
> minutes will help you to understand the discussion of the problem and
> its solution in the next section. And perhaps you will figure out a
> way of solving the problem yourself!
>
> 5.  Pudding is not both good and fattening.
>
> 6.  Pudding is both not good and not fattening.
>
> 7.  Pudding is not either good or fattening.
>
> 8.  Pudding is either not good or not fattening.
>
> 9.  Pudding is neither good nor fattening.

## Checkpoint 4: Truth Tables and the Meaning of ~, &, and V

Read pages 7-9 of Chapter 1 and then write a one paragraph summary of
Section 1-3 that is complete, simple, and concise. Write your answer as [a reply to this post](https://chapelfieldschools.sharepoint.com/sites/csp2018-19/SitePages/Checkpoint-4--Truth-Tables-and-the-Meaning-of-~,-&,-and-V.aspx).

## Checkpoint 5: Truth Functions

Read pages 9-10 of Chapter 1 before completing the exercise.

> **Exercise 1-3:** Try to explain what it would be for a declarative
> compound sentence in English not to be truth functional. Give an
> example of a declarative compound sentence in English that is not
> truth functional. There are lots of them!

Your answer should be developed in writing and must be complete, simple,
and concise. You will not move on to the next checkpoint unless your
answer addresses each part of the exercise. Write your answer as [a reply to this post](https://chapelfieldschools.sharepoint.com/sites/csp2018-19/SitePages/Checkpoint-5--Truth-Functions.aspx).

<p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>

## Checkpoint 6: Compounding Compound Sentences

Read pages 11-15 of Chapter 1 before completing the exercise.

> **Exercise 1-4:** For each of the following sentences, state whether
> its main connective is ~, &, or v and list each
> sentence's components. Then do the same for the components you have
> listed until you get down to atomic sentence letters. So you can see
> how you should present your answers, I have done the first problem for
> you.
>
>   -------------- --------------------- ----------------
>    **Sentence**   **Main Connective**   **Components**
>
>    ~(Av~B)        ~                     Av~B
>
>    Av~B           v                     A, ~B
>
>    ~B             ~                     B
>   -------------- --------------------- ----------------
>
> 1.  (D&~G)v(G&D)
>
> 2.  [(Dv~~B)&(DvB)]&(DvB)
>
> 3.  L&{Mv[~N&(Mv~L)]}
>
Work out the solutions on paper and only type in the final solution. For
example, the solution for the sample problem would be ~B.

## Checkpoint 7: Rules of Formation and Rules of Valuation

Read pages 16-18 of Chapter 1 before completing the exercises.

> **Exercise 1-5:** Which of the following expressions are sentences of
> sentence logic and which are not?
>
> 1.  A&~B
> 2.  A~&B
> 3.  Gv(~B&~H)
> 4.  A&(C&~(DvH))
> 5.  (A&B)v(C&D)
> 6.  (AvB)&CvD

Your answer should be developed in writing and must be complete, simple,
