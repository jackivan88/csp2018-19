    <p>You'll need to use your OpenBSD 6.3 VM for this lesson. Boot it up and log into the csp user.</p>
    <h2 id="checkpoint-1-launching-nano">Checkpoint 1: Launching Nano</h2>
    <p>There are three ways to launch Nano. The first is launching it with only the <code>nano</code> command. The
        second is launching it and simultaneously creating a new file. The third is launching it and editing an
        existing file.</p>
    <p>Open the terminal. Type <code>nano</code> without any arguments or flags and press Enter. You should see this:</p>

        width="800" height="485" />
    <p>Close Nano by pressing Control-X. Now, type <code>nano foo.md</code> and press Enter. You should see this:</p>
    <img src="images/chrome_2016-09-25_16-09-29.png" title="This is what you should see when you launch Nano with a new file argument."
        width="800" height="485" />
    <p>You can see at the top of the terminal that the file name is listed. Type in a sentence or two and then close
        Nano by pressing Control-X. This time, Nano will ask you to confirm your changes by pressing Y, or discard them
        by pressing N. You can cancel by pressing Control-C. Save your changes and confirm the filename by pressing
        Enter.</p>
    <p>Now type <code>nano foo.md</code> and press Enter. You should see the same file again. Add a new line at the
        bottom of the file and type <code>I've completed Checkpoint 1</code>. The close the file by pressing Control-X.
        Press Y, but this time change the name of the file to <code>checkpoint1.md</code> before you press Enter.</p>
    <p>Stream the contents of the new file to your terminal using <code>cat</code> and then raise your hand.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint. Alternatively, you may record your screen as you
        complete each step from this checkpoint and submit the videos for credit.</p>
    <h2 id="checkpoint-2-saving">Checkpoint 2: Saving</h2>
    <p>Open <code>foo.md</code> in nano and delete all the text inside. Then press Control-O to save the file without
        closing it. If you've done this correctly, your screen should look like this:</p>
    <img src="images/chrome_2016-09-25_18-24-59.png" title="What you should see if you&#39;ve saved the file correctly."
        width="800" height="485" />
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint. Alternatively, you may record your screen as you
        complete each step from this checkpoint and submit the videos for credit.</p>
    <h2 id="checkpoint-3-read-file">Checkpoint 3: Read File</h2>
    <p>You should still have <code>foo.md</code> open from the last checkpoint. If not, open it now. Then press
        Control-R to read another file and insert it into the current file. Type in <code>checkpoint1.md</code> when it
        prompts you and press Enter. Now <code>foo.md</code> contains the exact contents of <code>checkpoint1.md</code>.</p>
    <img src="images/chrome_2016-09-25_18-31-33.png" title="You should see something similar after you read the contents of checkpoint1.md into foo.md."
        width="800" height="485" />
    <p>What happens if you run this command on a file that's not empty? Go ahead and exit Nano, and be sure to save
        your changes.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint. Alternatively, you may record your screen as you
        complete each step from this checkpoint and submit the videos for credit.</p>
    <h2 id="checkpoint-4-getting-help">Checkpoint 4: Getting Help</h2>
    <p>Open Nano and press Control-G. This takes you to the manual for the program if you ever need to reference it
        while you're working. Skim through the whole file before moving on.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint. Alternatively, you may record your screen as you
        complete each step from this checkpoint and submit the videos for credit.</p>
    <h2 id="checkpoint-5-copy-cut-and-paste">Checkpoint 5: Copy, Cut, and Paste</h2>
    <p>Type the following, including blank lines, into a new file called <code>checkpoint5.md</code>:</p>
    <img src="images/chrome_2016-09-25_19-00-05.png" width="800" height="485" />
    <p>Now, move your cursor to the beginning of one of the numbered lines using the arrow keys. Press Control-K to cut
        the line. Then move your cursor somewhere else in the list and press Control-U to uncut (paste) the text in.
        Try this in other places until you're comfortable, and then move everything back to the original layout.</p>
    <p>Then press Alt-A (Alt is the Meta key in Nano) to start highlighting, and then use the arrow keys to move around
        and highlight text. Then press Alt-6 to copy the highlighted text. Go ahead and paste it somewhere else. Then
        remove the extra text using Control-K until the file looks like the original. Exit and save.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint. Alternatively, you may record your screen as you
        complete each step from this checkpoint and submit the videos for credit.</p>
    <h2 id="checkpoint-6-find-and-replace">Checkpoint 6: Find and Replace</h2>
    <p>Open a new file in Nano called <code>checkpoint6.md</code> and use Control-R to read the contents of <code>checkpoint5.md</code>
        into it. Then save the file. Now, press Control-W and find the word &quot;rice&quot; in the file. You'll notice
        that once you press Enter the cursor moves to the beginning of the word you searched for. Try this with several
        different words.</p>
    <p>Now use Control-\ to search for a word and then replace it. In this case, we will search for the word
        &quot;Rice&quot; and replace it with the words &quot;Brown rice&quot;. Try doing this with several other words.</p>
    <p>Now do a search for the word &quot;Here&quot; and replace it with &quot;There&quot;. But this time, instead of
        just confirming the change, we want to press A to change all occurrences of &quot;Here&quot; at the same time.</p>
    <img src="images/2016-09-25_20-06-54.gif" width="800" height="486" />
    <p>Notice that your last search is saved every time you search, so you can just press enter to do the same search
        again. Then save and exit.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint. Alternatively, you may record your screen as you
        complete each step from this checkpoint and submit the videos for credit.</p>
