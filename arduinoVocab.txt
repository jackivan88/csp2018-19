digitalRead()	Reads the value from a specified digital pin, either HIGH or LOW.
digitalWrite()	Write a HIGH or a LOW value to a digital pin.
pinMode()	Configures the specified pin to behave either as an input or an output.
analogRead()	Reads the value from the specified analog pin.
analogReference()	Configures the reference voltage used for analog input (i.e. the value used as the top of the input range).
analogWrite()	Writes an analog value (PWM wave) to a pin.
noTone()	Stops the generation of a square wave triggered by tone(). Has no effect if no tone is being generated.
pulseIn()	Reads a pulse (either HIGH or LOW) on a pin.
pulseInLong()	An alternative to pulseIn() which is better at handling long pulse and interrupt affected scenarios.
shiftIn()	Shifts in a byte of data one bit at a time.
shiftOut()	Shifts out a byte of data one bit at a time.
tone()	Generates a square wave of the specified frequency (and 50% duty cycle) on a pin.
delay()	Pauses the program for the amount of time (in milliseconds) specified as parameter.
delayMicroseconds()	Pauses the program for the amount of time (in microseconds) specified as parameter.
micros()	Returns the number of microseconds since the Arduino board began running the current program.
millis()	Returns the number of milliseconds since the Arduino board began running the current program.
abs()	Calculates the absolute value of a number.
constrain()	Constrains a number to be within a range.
map()	Re-maps a number from one range to another.
max()	Calculates the maximum of two numbers.
min()	Calculates the minimum of two numbers.
