    <p>In this lesson you will use your Arduino as primitive calculators to perform addition, subtraction,
        multiplication,
        and division. You will also implement <a
            href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/structure/control-structure/while/"><code>while</code></a>
        and
        <a
            href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/structure/control-structure/switchcase/"><code>switch</code></a>
        in addition to <a
            href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/structure/control-structure/else/"><code>if / else</code></a>
        statements.</p>

    <p>Get your supplies and take out only the Arduino and the USB cable. Connect your Arduino to your laptop, open the
        Arduino IDE, and make sure the correct port is selected.</p>
    <h2 id="checkpoint-2-set-up-setup">Checkpoint 2: Set Up Setup</h2>
    <p>Open a new sketch. Use <code>Serial.begin()</code> to open a 9600-baud serial connection when the Arduino powers
        on.
        Save the new program as <em>serialCalculate</em>. Upload the sketch to your Arduino and then add, commit, and
        push
        your changes.</p>

    <h2 id="checkpoint-3-program-scope">Checkpoint 3: Program Scope</h2>
    <p>You need to decide what you want a program to accomplish so that you can design it appropriately. In this case,
        you
        know that you want to perform four operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. However, you
        also
        need to decide how many numbers you want the program to work with and whether those numbers should be <a
            href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/variables/data-types/int/">integers</a>, <a
            href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/variables/data-types/long/">longs</a>, or <a
            href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/variables/data-types/float/">floating point numbers</a>.
        Integers
        are whole numbers up to 16 bits in size, longs are whole numbers up to 32 bits in size, and floats are numbers
        with
        decimal values up to 32 bits in size.</p>
    <p>Look at your reference to determine the largest possible integer and long your Arduino can handle. For now, you
        will
        work with integers.</p>
    <p>At the very beginning of your program, you should declare global variables so that they are available for your
        entire
        program to use. You will declare four variables so that your program can perform operations involving two
        numbers. Add
        the following lines of code at the top of your program:</p>
    <pre><code>int number1;
char sign;
int number2;
int result;</code></pre>
    <p>This tells your Arduino that you want three integer variables to work with along with one character variable.
        Save,
        add, commit, and push your code. Then be prepared to explain what information will go in each variable.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">
        Have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint before moving on.
    </p>
    <h2 id="checkpoint-4-set-up-loop">Checkpoint 4: Set Up Loop</h2>
    <p>We need to set up your program to handle incoming serial data. Before you write the actual code, we’re going to
        create a test to make sure your incoming data is being processed. Add the following code to your
        <code>void loop()</code> section:</p>
    <pre><code>while (Serial.available() &gt; 0) {
    char inbound = Serial.read();
    Serial.println(inbound);
}</code></pre>
    <p>We are declaring a <code>char</code> variable within the <code>while</code> statement, which means it won’t be
        available everywhere in your program. This is acceptable here. Now, upload your code and type something into the
        serial monitor. Your program should send back what you typed, broken into one character per line. Try a few
        different
        strings of text. Then, change your <code>Serial.println(inbound);</code> to
        <code>Serial.println(inbound, HEX);</code>
        and see what happens when you send text. You’ll notice that you’re getting back more characters than you sent.
        Why do
        you think this is? Try <code>BIN</code> and <code>OCT</code> to see what happens. These return what you sent in
        hexadecimal, binary, and octal respectively. But why are there more characters than when you first ran the test?
    </p>
    <p><em>Hint: this is why you used <code>.trim</code> in the Serial lesson.</em></p>
    <p class="checkpoint">
        Have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint before moving on.
    </p>
    <h2 id="checkpoint-5-sanitizing-data">Checkpoint 5: Sanitizing Data</h2>
    <p>This gives you an opportunity to build a tool that will clean out certain characters from your serial input.
        Let’s
        assume you only want to use visible characters and get rid of line feeds, newlines, spaces, and other
        “invisible”
        characters. The Arduino library has a function designed to detect whether a character has visible content called
        <code>isGraph()</code>. Replace your <code>void loop()</code> content with:</p>
    <pre><code>while (Serial.available() &gt; 0) {
    char inbound = Serial.read();
    if (isGraph(inbound)) {
        Serial.println(inbound);
    }
}</code></pre>
    <p>Now type in a complete sentence and send it to your Arduino. Your result should come back with all the spaces
        removed. This will help you clean up your data and make it easier to work with. Now, create a function called
        <code>void cleanData()</code> at the bottom of your program and cut and paste the content of your
        <code>void loop()</code> into this new function. Call the function in your now-empty <code>void loop()</code>,
        which
        should look like this:</p>
    <pre><code>void loop() {
    cleanData();
}</code></pre>
    <p>Upload your code and test it. It should work exactly as it did before, but now you’ve created your own function
        that
        can be used anywhere in your code. <em>However, variables declared within this function aren’t available
            anywhere else
            yet.</em> Add, commit, and push your code.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">
        Have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint before moving on.
    </p>
    <h2 id="checkpoint-6-create-and-test-an-array">Checkpoint 6: Create and Test an Array</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/variables/data-types/array/">Arrays</a> allow you to store
        a
        collection of variables, such as integers or characters, and then access them again later. Since you are trying
        to
        store information about numbers and characters, for now you will store them in a <code>char</code> array. Later
        you
        will parse the information out into integers and characters.</p>
    <p>Because you are designing this program with your own functions, you are going to create a new function called
        <code>printCleanData()</code> that will help you test your modifications, add some global variables, and make
        changes
        to your <code>cleanData()</code> function.</p>
    <h2 id="checkpoint-7-declare-global-variables">Checkpoint 7: Declare Global Variables</h2>
    <p>At the top of your program, declare a character array for your data that has 32 slots:</p>
    <pre><code>char cleanData[32];</code></pre>
    <p>Then, declare a new type of variable: the <a
            href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/variables/data-types/bool/">boolean</a>. This variable
        will be
        used to tell the program whether or not there is new data to work with when you change your
        <code>cleanData()</code>
        function.</p>
    <pre><code>bool newData = false;</code></pre>
    <p>Why do you use a boolean variable, and what are the possible states for a boolean variable?</p>
    <h2 id="checkpoint-8-edit-cleandata">Checkpoint 8: Edit cleanData()</h2>
    <p>Modify your <code>cleanData()</code> function to pass your serial input along to the new <code>cleanData</code>
        array. First, declare a new integer variable called <em>count</em> and set it to zero. You should do this before
        your
        <code>while</code> loop at the very beginning, otherwise it won’t be available later when you need it. Then,
        change
        your <code>if</code> statement from:</p>
    <pre><code>if (isGraph(inbound)) {
    Serial.println(inbound);
}</code></pre>
    <p>to:</p>
    <pre><code>if (isGraph(inbound)) {
    newData = true;
    cleanData[count] = inbound;
    count++;
}</code></pre>
    <p>This will send the data to your array instead of the serial monitor. First, it flips the boolean from
        <em>false</em>
        to <em>true</em>, which you will take advantage of later. Then it sends each character to a slot in the array
        based on
        the <code>count</code> variable. Remember that many times in programming, lists or arrays start at zero, not
        one. This
        is true in C++, which is what you are using to program your Arduino. Therefore, at the moment, the
        <code>count</code>
        variable is zero, since that’s what you set it to at the beginning of your <code>while</code> statement. We’re
        placing
        the <code>inbound</code> variable’s value in slot 0 of the array. However, the next time the loop runs, you want
        it to
        place the next character in the next slot, so you use the <code>++</code> iterator. Iterating is simply adding
        to the
        previous value. So if <code>count</code> was zero before, <code>count++</code> makes it one. The next time it
        will be
        two, and so on. If you send “This is a test” to your Arduino, these modifications will result in the
        <code>cleanData</code> array containing <code>{ T, h, i, s, i, s, a, t, e, s, t ....}</code>.</p>
    <p>How many of your 32 slots would be in use at this point?</p>
    <h2 id="checkpoint-9-create-printcleandata">Checkpoint 9: Create printCleanData()</h2>
    <p>Running your program would work, but you wouldn’t be able to tell, so you’re going to design a temporary function
        to
        help you test it. You will take advantage of your <code>newData</code> boolean, learn how to test for
        equivalance,
        reset your array, and reset your boolean to indicate the program is ready to run again.</p>
    <p>Create a new function at the bottom of your program called <em>printCleanData</em> and then type in the following
        statement:</p>
    <pre><code>if (newData == true) {
    Serial.println(cleanData);
    char cleanData[32] = &quot;&quot;;
    newData = false;
}</code></pre>
    <p>At this point, make sure to format your code and verify it. Upload it and test it by sending the Arduino several
        phrases and sentences to see if you get clean data back. If you don’t, see if you can figure out what’s missing
        from
        your <code>void loop()</code> function and fix it. Upload and test, and if your code works, go ahead and add,
        commit,
        and push your code.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">
        Have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint before moving on.
    </p>
    <h2 id="checkpoint-10-modify-printcleandata">Checkpoint 10: Modify printCleanData()</h2>
    <p>Go ahead and change <code>printCleanData()</code> to <code>parseData()</code> everywhere it appears in the
        program.
        Then rename your array to <em>integers</em>. Now it’s time to use the variables you declared at the beginning of
        the
        program. Replace</p>
    <pre><code>Serial.println(cleanData);
char cleanData[32] = &quot;&quot;;</code></pre>
    <p>with</p>
    <pre><code>number1 = integers[0];
number2 = integers[1];
Serial.println(number1);
Serial.println(sign);
Serial.println(number2);</code></pre>
    <p>Note that when you are assigning a value to a variable, the variable goes on the left of the equation, but when
        you
        are using it as a value for something else, it goes on the right. The <code>Serial.println()</code> functions
        will
        help you test the program. Add, commit, and push your code.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">
        Have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint before moving on.
    </p>
    <h2 id="checkpoint-11-modify-cleandata">Checkpoint 11: Modify cleanData()</h2>
    <p>Now, you need to make significant changes to <code>cleanData()</code>.</p>
    <pre><code>void cleanData() {
    count = 0;
    while (Serial.available() &gt; 0) {
        newData = true;
        if (isDigit(Serial.peek()) == true) {
            integers[count] = Serial.parseInt();
            count++;
            Serial.print(&quot;The current count is &quot;);
            Serial.println(count);
        }
        else if (isGraph(Serial.peek()) == true) {
            sign = Serial.read();
            Serial.println(sign);
        }
        else {
            Serial.read();
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
    <p>As before, the <code>cleanData()</code> function sets <code>count</code> to zero, and you still have a
        <code>while</code> statement. You’re also still toggling your <code>newData</code> boolean to true, which your
        program
        will use later on. Your <code>if</code> statement is where things start to get a little more complicated.
        <code>(isDigit(Serial.peek()) == true)</code> tests to see if the incoming serial data starts with a digit by
        using
        <code>Serial.peek()</code>. Peek looks at the data without removing it from the serial buffer, which lets you do
        something depending on what it is. In this case, you’re checking to see if it’s a digit, and if it is, you’re
        running
        the <code>parseInt()</code> function and storing the result in the first slot of the <code>integers</code>
        array.
        You’re then iterating <code>count</code> and printing the current count to the serial monitor.</p>
    <p>Now, study the <code>else if</code> and <code>else</code> statements and prepare to explain what they do. <em>If
            you
            run the program at this point it will not work. We will address this in the next checkpoint, but feel free
            to try it
            and see what happens.</em> Add, commit, and push your code.</p>

    </p>
    <h2 id="checkpoint-12-fix-cleandata">Checkpoint 12: Fix cleanData()</h2>
    <p>The reason your code will not work is because your microcontroller is so much faster than your serial connection.
        Thus, it can read a byte from the serial buffer and cycle through the whole program in less time than it takes
        for the
        next byte to arrive. So you will get unusual errors in your results because of incomplete data transfer. There
        are
        multiple ways to solve this, and <a href="http://gammon.com.au/serial">the optimal solution</a> involves storing
        the
        serial buffer locally where it can be parsed as quickly as possible. However, a conceptually simpler, but
        slower,
        solution is to artificially delay the program long enough for the serial connection to keep up. To do this, add
        a
        one-millisecond delay to your <em>isDigit</em> and <em>isGraph</em> statements and test your program again.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">
        Have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint before moving on.
    </p>
    <h2 id="checkpoint-13-switch">Checkpoint 13: switch</h2>
    <p>Now it is time to actually crunch numbers. Create a new function called <em>calculate</em> and open it with an
        <code>if</code> statement that tests whether <code>readyToCalculate</code> is <em>true</em>. You should also
        create a
        <code>Serial.println</code> that will let you know this function is running to help you debug errors. Then,
        create a
        <a
            href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/structure/control-structure/switchcase/"><code>switch</code></a>
        control structure. It will look like:</p>
    <pre><code>switch (var) {
    case label1:
    // statements
    break;
    case label2:
    // statements
    break;
    default:
    // statements
    break;
}</code></pre>
    <p>Your <code>switch</code> control structure is based on your <code>sign</code> variable and should start like
        this:
    </p>
    <pre><code>switch (sign) {
    case &#39;+&#39; :
        result = number1 + number2;
        readyToPrint = true;
        break;</code></pre>
    <p>Create cases for the other three operations and then end with a default:</p>
    <pre><code>default:
      Serial.println(&quot;This operation is not supported. Please try again.&quot;);
      readyToPrint = false;
      break;</code></pre>
    <p>After you close your <code>switch</code>, toggle the <code>readyToCalculate</code> boolean to <em>false</em>. Add
        <code>Serial.print()</code> to each case to help debug any mistakes. Add your new function to
        <code>void loop()</code>
        and save, add, commit, and push your work.</p>

    <h2 id="checkpoint-14-show-your-work">Checkpoint 14: Show Your Work</h2>
    <p>It’s time to print. Create a function called <em>concatenateResultsAndPrint</em> and add it to your
        <code>void loop()</code> function. Create an <code>if</code> statement testing whether the
        <code>readyToPrint</code>
        boolean is <em>true</em>. Inside the <code>if</code> statement you will concatenate several variables and then
        print
        your results to the serial monitor. Declare a local <code>String</code> variable called
        <em>printCalculation</em> and
        set it to
        <code>String(number1) + ' ' + String(sign) + ' ' + String(number2) + String(" = ") + String(result);</code>
        This long line converts the <code>number1</code>, <code>sign</code>, <code>number2</code>, and
        <code>result</code>
        variables into strings and then fills in the necessary spaces and <em>equals</em> sign.</p>
    <p>Use the <code>Serial.println</code> function to print this new string and then prompt the user to enter another
        operation. Lastly, set the <code>readyToPrint</code> boolean to <em>false</em>. Test, save, add, commit, and
