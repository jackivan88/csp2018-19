        <p>This course is taught by Mr. Olinda, Chapel Field's Director of
        Technology. It is intended to give students a foundation in computer
        science. Members of the class are encouraged to participate in <code>
        HACK://CF</code> for additional STEM experience.</p>
        <p>This is a project-based course, although there will be periods where
        I will give direct instruction. The majority of your grade will come
        from projects that you will complete individually, although for most you
        will be allowed to work together.</p>
        <p>Whenever you finish working on the assigned lessons, you are expected
        to go back and complete any optional checkpoints. Once those are
        complete, you are free to work on your stretch projects during class
        time. However all students must earn a certain number of points per
        quarter through stretch projects. Points earned beyond the required
        amount are extra credit. You can keep track of your stretch projects on
        Trello.</p>
