    <h2>Checkpoint 1: Which Version?</h2>
    <p>First, press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Windows-X</span> on your keyboard. A menu should appear in the
        lower-left corner of your screen. Choose System. This will bring up your computer's information. See if you can
        find the name of your operating system. If nothing happened when you pressed Windows-X, then click the Windows
        icon at the lower-left corner of your screen. On the right-hand side of the Start Menu you'll see Computer as
        one of the choices. Right-click on it and select Properties. You should be able to see the <i>edition</i> of
        your operating system.</p>

    <h2>Checkpoint 2: Lock and Unlock</h2>
    <p>To lock your computer, press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Windows-L</span>. This will immediately lock the
        computer. Then log back in by pressing <span class="keyboardShortcut">CTRL-ALT-Delete</span>.</p>
    <p>Go to the Start Menu and click on the small icon of a person. You should see an option to lock your computer.
        Choose it and then unlock the computer again.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>
    <h2>Checkpoint 3: Sleep and Wake</h2>
    <p>Sleep is just a term we use to describe computers that are in a low-power mode that allows them to be used
        quickly. When you press the power button on your phone to turn off the screen, it is in sleep mode. Go to the
        Start Menu and find the option labeled Sleep under your power options. Press it and see what happens. Then move
        the cursor or press a key to wake it back up.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>
    <h2>Checkpoint 4: Shutdown and Startup</h2>
    <p>To completely power down your computer, go to the Start Menu and choose Shut Down. Your computer should be
        completely powered off within a few seconds. Then how do you turn it back on? If your computer was completely
        frozen, meaning that it won't respond to you, you can force it to shut down by holding down the power button
        for several seconds. However, this is never a good idea if your computer isn't frozen. Always shut down the
        computer by choosing Shut Down from the Start Menu.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>
    <h2>Checkpoint 5: Restart</h2>
    <p>Now, go to the Start Menu and choose Restart. Your computer should shut down and then start back up on its own
        without you doing anything. </p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>
    <h2>Checkpoint 6: What's Going On?</h2>
    <p>If your computer is running slowly or you think there is something wrong, it is a good idea to check the Task
        Manager. Right-click on the taskbar and choose Task Manager. Then click More Details to expand it and see more
        information.</p>
    <p>Try the different tabs and see what you can learn about your computer from this tool. Then go online and see if
        you can find out what keyboard shortcut brings up the Task Manager.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>
    <h2>Checkpoint 7: The Taskbar</h2>
    <p>You've already used the Taskbar several times, but now it's time to learn what the different parts do. At the
        far left you should have the Start Menu. At the far right edge is a small button. Click it and see what
        happens. Now press each button on the Taskbar (except for the applications) and see what they do. Then
        right-click on the Taskbar and try the different options.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>
    <h2>Checkpoint 8: Common Shortcuts</h2>
    <p>Windows has several modifier keys. They change the behavior of the other keys on your keyboard although the
        Windows key also works all by itself.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shift ⇧</li>
        <li>Caps Lock</li>
        <li>Ctrl</li>
        <li>Alt</li>
        <li>Windows (usually looks like the Start Menu icon)</li>
        <li>Fn</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You should know each of the modifier keys and be able to press the right one when asked. <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/198122/32-new-keyboard-shortcuts-in-the-windows-10-technical-preview/">This
            article contains the most important shortcuts for Windows 10.</a> Try each of them out and make sure you
        know what they do. One of the most important shortcuts is <span class="keyboardShortcut">Alt-Tab</span> for
        switching between windows. You must learn to use this instead of the mouse. Once you're done you will be asked
        to try several at random. Once you can do at least five from memory you'll be able to move on. If you're using
        an older version of Windows your shortcuts will be slightly different.</p>
