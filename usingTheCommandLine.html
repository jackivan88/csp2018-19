        <h1>Using the Command Line</h1>

    <p>Most of the time we are using computers and other electronic devices, we are using what is known as a graphical
        user interface, or GUI. These interfaces are a layer between the user - you - and the machine. Before graphical
        user interfaces were common, most machines were run using the command line. All three major operating systems -
        Linux, Windows, and macOS - have a command line, even though you don’t have to use them. We are going to
        practice using PowerShell and ksh.</p>
    <p>This is a much longer lesson, so don't get frustrated if it takes you longer than you think it should. <strong>You
            may record videos of your screen in order to complete these without me being there with you. After you’ve
            practiced the steps once, go back and record yourself doing the steps again and name the resulting video
            1.2 Using the Command Line Checkpoint 1 (and change the number according to which checkpoint it is for).
            Then write “video” on your checksheet and I will collect the videos later for grading.</strong></p>
    <h2 id="powershell">PowerShell</h2>
    <p>Open the Start Menu and search for <code>Windows PowerShell</code>. It should be the
        first result, but make sure you do not choose any options ending in ISE. You should see a window that looks
        like this:</p>
    <p><img src="images/powershell_2016-09-03_12-46-57.png" title="Windows PowerShell Interface" alt="Windows PowerShell Interface"
            width="800" height="561" /></p>
    <p>Yours should show your user name instead of &quot;John Olinda,&quot; but other than that it should appear
        identical. I'll refer to the &quot;prompt&quot; throughout this lesson and throughout the course. The
        PowerShell prompt ends in the <code>&gt;</code> symbol and indicates that you can type commands. Sometimes I
        will ask you to clear your terminal by typing <code>clear</code> and pressing <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>.
        This will erase the content of the command line, but it will not undo previous commands.</p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-1-pwd">Checkpoint 1: pwd</h3>
    <p>This command is an abbreviation for “print working directory”. This command shows you what directory (folder)
        you're in, which can be helpful if you are lost. Before you do anything else, just type <code>pwd</code> at the
        prompt and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. Do this three times.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">
        Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.
    </p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-2-cd">Checkpoint 2: cd</h3>
    <p>This command is an abbreviation for &quot;change directory.&quot; It allows you to move from one directory
        (folder) to another in the command line. It can also reset your working directory to your home directory, which
        can be much faster than changing directories one level at a time.</p>
    <p>Type <code>cd</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. Notice that nothing changed. This is
        because you just told the computer to change to the current directory.</p>
    <p>Type <code>cd Downloads</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. Check to see if your
        prompt now includes the Downloads folder just before the <code>&gt;</code> symbol. Now, any commands you
        execute will run in this directory (folder) instead of your home directory.</p>
    <p>Type <code>cd ..</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. Check to see what your current
        working directory is. It should be your home directory. If you're not sure, just type <code>pwd</code> and
        press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span> to check. If you went down another directory, you could type
        <code>cd ../..</code> to go back up twice with one command. We will practice this in the next checkpoint.</p>
    <p>Type <code>cd Mu</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Tab</span>. PowerShell should fill in the
        missing letters and show <code>cd .\Music\</code> instead. Now press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>.
        When you're using the command line, you can press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Tab</span> to autocomplete the
        command, directory, or file that you are working on instead of typing the whole command.</p>
    <p>Next, type <code>cd ~</code> and notice that you're back in your home directory.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">
        Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.
    </p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-3-mkdir">Checkpoint 3: mkdir</h3>
    <p>This command creates a new directory inside your working directory. You should be in your home directory. If
        not, type <code>cd ~</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span> to go there. Then type <code>mkdir test</code>
        and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span> to create a directory called &quot;test&quot; inside your
        home directory. Then type <code>cd test</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span> to go down
        into the directory you just created.</p>
    <p>Type <code>mkdir anotherTest</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span> to create another
        directory inside the &quot;test&quot; directory. Then type <code>cd anotherTest</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>
        to go down into this new directory.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">
        Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.
    </p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-4-ls">Checkpoint 4: ls</h3>
    <p>This command lists the files and directories inside the current working directory. Type <code>cd ~</code> and
        press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span> to go back to your home directory. Then type <code>ls</code>
        and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span> to see what's inside the directory.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">
        Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.
    </p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-5-rmdir">Checkpoint 5: rmdir</h3>
    <p>This command removes directories. Type <code>cd ~</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>
        to return to your home directory. press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Windows-E</span> and go to your home
        directory so you can see the changes you make in PowerShell reflected in File Explorer. Then navigate down to
        the &quot;test&quot; directory. Type <code>rmdir             anotherTest</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>
        to delete the &quot;anotherTest&quot; directory and then use <code>ls</code> to make sure it has been deleted.
        Go back to your home directory and delete the &quot;test&quot; directory. Use <code>ls</code> to make sure you
        have removed it. When you check your home directory in File Explorer you should see that both directories are
        gone.</p>
    <p>Now, type <code>mkdir -p test/anotherTest</code> (or on Windows 8, <code>mkdir -Path test/anotherTest</code>)
        and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. The <code>-p</code> is what we call a flag and it allows
        us to modify commands to do something slightly different. In this case, the <code>-p</code> flag allows us to
        create two directories, one inside the other, at the same time. Now type <code>rmdir test</code> and see what
        happens.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">
        Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.
    </p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-6-pushd-popd">Checkpoint 6: pushd, popd</h3>
    <p>These two commands allow you to quickly switch between different directories. It works a little differently in
        PowerShell than it will in ksh.</p>
    <p>First, type <code>mkdir -p test/anotherTest/yetAnotherTest</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>.
        Then type <code>pushd             test/anotherTest/yetAnotherTest</code> and see what happens. Confirm that
        you're in the &quot;yetAnotherTest&quot; directory with <code>pwd</code>.</p>
    <p>Then type <code>popd</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. Now where are you? Confirm
        this with <code>pwd</code>.</p>
    <p>Use <code>ls</code> and <code>pushd</code> to move to another directory and then use <code>popd</code> to move
        back. Try this at least three more times using different directories.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">
        Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.
    </p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-7-new-item">Checkpoint 7: New-Item</h3>
    <p>This command allows you to create new files. First, use <code>cd</code> to move to the
        &quot;yetAnotherTest&quot; directory. Once you get there, type <code>New-Item test.txt</code> and press <span
            class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. Confirm you created a new file with <code>ls</code>.</p>
    <p>Then go back to your home directory using <code>cd</code> and type <code>New-Item test/anotherTest/yetAnotherTest/hello.txt</code>
        and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. Then confirm you created a new file by typing <code>ls test/anotherTest/yetAnotherTest/</code>
        and pressing Enter. You just created a file in a directory below your current working directory without
        actually moving there. Then you listed the contents of that directory without moving.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">
        Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.
    </p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-8-cp">Checkpoint 8: cp</h3>
    <p>This command allows you to copy files and directories from one place to another as well as within the same
        directory. Files can be copied exactly or renamed when copied.</p>
    <p>Move to the &quot;yetAnotherTest&quot; directory. Type <code>cp hello.txt howdy.txt</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>.
        Then use <code>ls</code> to see if you now have three files - test.txt, hello.txt, and howdy.txt - in the
        directory. You just copied the file and renamed it at the same time.</p>
    <p>Type <code>mkdir pleaseStop</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. Then type <code>cp hello.txt pleaseStop/</code>
        and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. Now when you use <code>ls</code> you should see a new
        directory inside &quot;yetAnotherTest&quot;.<br />
    </p>
    <p>Type <code>cp -r pleaseStop really</code> (or on Windows 8, type <code>cp -Recurse pleaseStop really</code>) and
        press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. Then use <code>ls</code> to make sure that you can see the
        &quot;really&quot; directory. You just copied a directory and its contents to a new directory. The <code>-r</code>
        flag stands for &quot;recurse&quot; which affects the directory and all of its contents.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">
        Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.
    </p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-9-mv">Checkpoint 9: mv</h3>
    <p>This command is similar to <code>cp</code> except that instead of copying the file, it moves the file to a new
        location. However, just like <code>cp</code>, <code>mv</code> can also rename files at the same time. In fact,
        most of the time you will use this command to rename files, not actually move them to a new place.</p>
    <p>Make sure you are in the &quot;yetAnotherTest&quot; directory and type <code>mv test.txt whenWillThisEnd.txt</code>
        and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. Then use <code>ls</code> to confirm that <code>test.txt</code>
        is now called <code>whenWillThisEnd.txt</code> instead.</p>
    <p>Now type <code>mv really yesReally</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. You can use
        <code>ls</code> to make sure you've renamed the directory correctly.</p>
    <p>Now use <code>mv</code> to rename whenWillThisEnd.txt and &quot;yesReally&quot; back to their original names.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">
        Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.
    </p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-10-more">Checkpoint 10: more</h3>
    <p>This command is used to display the contents of a text file, especially files that are too long to fit into your
        terminal window.</p>
    <p><a href="loremIpsum.txt">Download loremIpsum.txt</a> and save it to your Downloads folder. Then use <code>cp</code>
        to create a copy in the &quot;yetAnotherTest&quot; directory.</p>
    <p>Then type <code>more loremIpsum.txt</code> and notice that the whole file is displayed in your terminal window.
        If the file was too long you could use the space bar to display the next section until you had seen the whole
        file. This is called paging.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">
        Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.
    </p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-11-cat">Checkpoint 11: cat</h3>
    <p>Unlike the last command, this one streams the file to your terminal without any paging. But you can also stream
        multiple files to your terminal. First, open &quot;yetAnotherTest&quot; in File Explorer and add some text to
        each text file besides loremIpsum.txt using your text editor. Save each file and then move on.</p>
    <p>Type <code>cat loremIpsum.txt</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>.</p>
    <p>Type <code>cat loremIpsum.txt hello.txt test.txt</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>.
        What happened? Try just typing <code>cat</code> and then pressing Enter and entering the files individually.
        Then try the command with the text files in a different order.</p>
    <p>Can you stream the same file more than once in the same command? What happens if the output is too long for your
        terminal window?</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">
        Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.
    </p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-12-rm">Checkpoint 12: rm</h3>
    <p>Now we're going to clean up our files and directories from this lesson using the <code>rm</code> and <code>rmdir</code>
        commands.</p>
    <p>Make sure you're in the &quot;yetAnotherTest&quot; directory. Then type <code>rm loremIpsum.txt</code> and press
        <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. Use <code>ls</code> to see if the file is gone. Then use rm to
        delete all the other files in the directory.</p>
    <p>Now try to use <code>rmdir</code> to delete the &quot;pleaseStop&quot; and &quot;really&quot; directories. Does
        it work? In ksh you will get an error, but in PowerShell you are able to decide what to do with directories
        that aren't empty.</p>
    <p>Now use <code>cd</code> to go to your home directory. Then type <code>rm -r test</code> (remember to use <code>-Recurse</code>
        instead of <code>-r</code> in Windows 8) in order to delete the whole directory, including its contents.</p>
    <p>Both commands can delete directories and files, but which one do you use to delete files in the working
        directory? You should always use <code>rm</code> and <code>rmdir</code> very carefully since it's easy to
        damage your system by accidentally deleting files.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">
        Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.
    </p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-13-exit">Checkpoint 13: exit</h3>
    <p>This command allows you to close the terminal. Type <code>exit</code> and press Enter to close the terminal.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">
        Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.
    </p>

    <h2 id="ksh">ksh</h2>
    <p>You must use your OpenBSD virtual machine for this part of the exercise, so boot it up and log into the <code>csp</code>
        user. I'll refer to the &quot;prompt&quot; throughout this lesson and throughout the course. The ksh prompt
        ends in the $ symbol and indicates that you can type commands. Sometimes I will ask you to clear your terminal
        by typing <code>clear</code> and pressing Enter. This will erase the content of the command line, but it will
        not undo previous commands.</p>
    <p>In the virtual machine, type <code>su -l</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. Then type
        in the password for the root account that I gave you. <code>su -l</code> changes you to the root user and
        allows you to execute commands that affect all users, and can also damage the system. Use this wisely!</p>
    <p>Type <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq15.html"><code>pkg_add -u</code></a> and wait for it to finish.</p>
    <p>Type <code>pkg_add nano vim git curl</code> to install those four programs.</p>
    <p>Type <code>exit</code> to drop back to your <code>csp</code> user’s shell.</p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-14-pwd">Checkpoint 14: pwd</h3>
    <p>This command is an abbreviation for &quot;print working directory. This command shows you what directory
        (folder) you're in, which can be helpful if you are lost. Before you do anything else, just type <code>pwd</code>
        at the prompt and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. Do this three times.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="checkpoint">
        Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.
    </p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-15-cd">Checkpoint 15: cd</h3>
    <p>This command is an abbreviation for &quot;change directory.&quot; It allows you to move from one directory
        (folder) to another in the command line. It can also reset your working directory to your home directory, which
        can be much faster than changing directories one level at a time.</p>
    <p>Type <code>cd</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. Notice that nothing changed. This is
        because you just told the computer to change to the current directory.</p>
    <p>Type <code>cd Downloads</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. Check to see if your
        prompt now includes the Downloads folder just before the $ symbol. Now, any commands you execute will run in
        this directory (folder) instead of your home directory.</p>
    <p>Type <code>cd ..</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. Check to see what your current
        working directory is. It should be your home directory. If you're not sure, just type <code>pwd</code> and
        press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span> to check. If you went down another directory, you could type
        <code>cd ../..</code> to go back up twice with one command. We will practice this in the next checkpoint.</p>
    <p>Type <code>cd Mu</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Tab</span>. ksh should fill in the missing
        letters and show <code>cd Music/</code> instead. Now press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. When
        you're using the command line, you can press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Tab</span> to autocomplete the
        command, directory, or file that you are working on instead of typing the whole command.</p>
    <p>Next, type <code>cd ~</code> and notice that you're back in your home directory.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">
        Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.
    </p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-16-mkdir">Checkpoint 16: mkdir</h3>
    <p>This command creates a new directory inside your working directory. You should be in your home directory. If
        not, type <code>cd ~</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span> to go there. Then
        type <code>mkdir test</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span> to create a
        directory called &quot;test&quot; inside your home directory. Then type <code>cd test</code> and press <span
            class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span> to go down into the directory you just created.</p>
    <p>Type <code>mkdir anotherTest</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span> to create another
        directory inside the &quot;test&quot; directory. Then type <code>cd         anotherTest</code> and press <span
            class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span> to go down into this new directory.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">
        Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.
    </p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-17-ls">Checkpoint 17: ls</h3>
    <p>This command lists the files and directories inside the current working directory. Type <code>cd ~</code> and
        press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span> to go back to your home directory. Then type <code>ls</code>
        and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span> to see what's inside the directory.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">
        Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.
    </p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-18-rmdir">Checkpoint 18: rmdir</h3>
    <p>This command removes directories. Type <code>cd ~</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>
        to return to your home directory. Then navigate down to the &quot;test&quot; directory. Type <code>rmdir anotherTest</code>
        and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span> to delete the &quot;anotherTest&quot; directory and then
        use <code>ls</code> to make sure it has been deleted. Go back to your home directory and delete the
        &quot;test&quot; directory. Use <code>ls</code> to make sure you have removed it. When you check your home
        directory in the file browser you should see that both directories are gone.</p>
    <p>Now, type <code>mkdir -p test/anotherTest</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. The
        <code>-p</code> is what we call a flag and it allows us to modify commands to do something slightly different.
        In this case, the <code>-p</code> flag allows us to create two directories, one inside the other, at the same
        time. Now type <code>rmdir            test</code> and see what happens.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">
        Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.

    <h3 id="checkpoint-19-pushd-popd">Checkpoint 19: pushd, popd</h3>
    <p>These two commands allow you to quickly switch between different directories. It works a little differently in
        ksh than in PowerShell.</p>
    <p>First, type <code>mkdir -p test/anotherTest/yetAnotherTest</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>.
        Then type <code>pushd         test/anotherTest/yetAnotherTest</code> and see what happens. Confirm that you're
        in the &quot;yetAnotherTest&quot; directory with <code>pwd</code>.</p>
    <p>Then type <code>popd</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. Now where are you? Confirm
        this with <code>pwd</code>.</p>
    <p>Use <code>ls</code> and <code>pushd</code> to move to another directory and then use <code>popd</code> to move
        back. Try this at least three more times using different directories.</p>
    <p>Now, type <code>cd ~</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. Then type <code>pushd            test/anotherTest/yetAnotherTest</code>
        and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. Navigate to any other directory besides &quot;test&quot;
        and then type <code>pushd</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>.</p>
    <p>When you run a command all by itself, you're running it without any arguments. What happened when you ran <code>pushd</code>
        without any arguments?</p>

    <h3 id="checkpoint-20-touch">Checkpoint 20: touch</h3>
    <p>This command allows you to create new files. First, use <code>cd</code> to move to the
        &quot;yetAnotherTest&quot; directory. Once you get there, type <code>touch test.txt</code> and press <span
            class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. Confirm you created a new file with <code>ls</code>.</p>
    <p>Then go back to your home directory using <code>cd</code> and type <code>touch test/anotherTest/yetAnotherTest/hello.txt</code>
        and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. Then confirm you created a new file by typing <code>ls            test/anotherTest/yetAnotherTest/</code>
        and pressing Enter. You just created a file in a directory below your current working directory without
        actually moving there. Then you listed the contents of that directory without moving.</p>

    <h3 id="checkpoint-21-cp">Checkpoint 21: cp</h3>
    <p>This command allows you to copy files and directories from one place to another as well as within the same
        directory. Files can be copied exactly or renamed when copied.</p>
    <p>Move to the &quot;yetAnotherTest&quot; directory. Type <code>cp hello.txt         howdy.txt</code> and press
        <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. Then use <code>ls</code> to see if you now have three files -
        test.txt, hello.txt, and howdy.txt - in the directory. You just copied the file and renamed it at the same
        time.</p>
    <p>Type <code>mkdir pleaseStop</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. Then type <code>cp            hello.txt pleaseStop/</code>
        and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. Now when you use <code>ls</code> you should see a new
        directory inside &quot;yetAnotherTest&quot;.</p>
    <p>Type <code>cp -r pleaseStop really</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. Then use <code>ls</code>
        to make sure that you can see the &quot;really&quot; directory. You just copied a directory and its contents to
        a new directory. The <code>-r</code> flag stands for &quot;recurse&quot; which affects the directory and all of
        its contents.</p>

    </p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-22-mv">Checkpoint 22: mv</h3>
    <p>This command is similar to <code>cp</code> except that instead of copying the file, it moves the file to a new
        location. However, just like <code>cp</code>, <code>mv</code> can also rename files at the same time. In fact,
        most of the time you will use this command to rename files, not actually move them to a new place.</p>
    <p>Make sure you are in the &quot;yetAnotherTest&quot; directory and type <code>mv            test.txt whenWillThisEnd.txt</code>
        and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. Then use <code>ls</code> to confirm that test.txt is now
        called whenWillThisEnd.txt instead.</p>
    <p>Now type <code>mv really yesReally</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. You can use
        <code>ls</code> to make sure you've renamed the directory correctly.</p>
    <p>Now use <code>mv</code> to rename whenWillThisEnd.txt and &quot;yesReally&quot; back to their original names.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">
        Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.
    </p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-23-less">Checkpoint 23: less</h3>
    <p>This command is used to display the contents of a text file, especially files that are too long to fit into your
        terminal window.</p>
    <p>Use cd to move to the &quot;yetAnotherTest&quot; directory. Then type <code>curl           -O</code> and the <a
            href="loremIpsum.txt">URL (link) of the loremIpsum.txt file</a> to download the file to the working
        directory.</p>
    <p>Then type <code>less loremIpsum.txt</code> and notice that the whole file is too large to display in your
        terminal window. Use the space bar to display the next section until you have seen the whole file. This is
        called paging.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">
        Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.
    </p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-24-cat">Checkpoint 24: cat</h3>
    <p>Unlike the last command, this one streams the file to your terminal without any paging. But you can also stream
        multiple files to your terminal. First, press the Home button and open &quot;yetAnotherTest&quot; in the Browse
        Files application and add some text to each text file besides loremIpsum.txt using your text editor. Save each
        file and then move on.</p>
    <p>Type <code>cat loremIpsum.txt</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>.</p>
    <p>Type <code>cat loremIpsum.txt hello.txt test.txt</code> and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>.
        Then try the command with the text files in a different order.</p>
    <p>Can you stream the same file more than once in the same command? What happens if the output is too long for your
        terminal window?</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">
        Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.
    </p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-25-rm">Checkpoint 25: rm</h3>
    <p>Now we're going to clean up our files and directories from this lesson using the <code>rm</code> and <code>rmdir</code>
        commands.</p>
    <p>Make sure you're in the &quot;yetAnotherTest&quot; directory. Then type <code>rm            loremIpsum.txt</code>
        and press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Enter</span>. Use <code>ls</code> to see if the file is gone. Then use
        rm to delete all the other files in the directory.</p>
    <p>Now try to use <code>rmdir</code> to delete the &quot;pleaseStop&quot; and &quot;really&quot; directories. Does
        it work? In ksh you will get an error, but in PowerShell you are able to decide what to do with directories
        that aren't empty.</p>
    <p>Now use <code>cd</code> to go to your home directory. Then type <code>rm -rf test</code> in order to delete the
        whole directory, including its contents. The <code>-f</code> flag means &quot;force&quot; which deletes the
        directory even if there are things inside it.</p>
    <p>Both commands can delete directories and files, but which one do you use to delete files in the working
        directory? You should always use <code>rm</code> and <code>rmdir</code> very carefully since it's easy to
        damage your system by accidentally deleting files.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">
        Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.
    </p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-26-exit">Checkpoint 26: exit</h3>
    <p>This command allows you to close the terminal. Type <code>exit</code> and press Enter to close the terminal. You
        can then power down your virtual machine.</p>
